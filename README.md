# Out_of_Keys

Unity game made in 48 hours for GMTK Jam 2019. You can get .exe version or try browser version on [itch.io](https://newfoldergames.itch.io/out-of-keys).

I'm planning to remake this game!

### Description

Help Red Panda to reach the yummy bamboo tree!

Remember, you can't tell them what to do again. Red Panda don't like being told what to do again, just like us.

Oh, no! Did Red Panda got tired of your stuff? Press Enter! Red Panda will resurrect from unknown void and will listen to you again! ~~I do that too in real life when I get tired of people. Funny isn't it?~~

### Side note

Thank you, GMTK, for making me an opportunity to finally wake up and do something, lol!

I couldn't add more movement options and stages since I spend a lot of time fixing movement.

WebGL one runs like presentation slides on Firefox for some reason?
